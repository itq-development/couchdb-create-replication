# Create CouchDB Replication

Shell script that creates a replication between two databases. The only dependencies are `bash` and `curl`.

See [CouchDB Replication](https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Replication) or Google "couchdb replication" for background.

# Install

```
curl -L -O https://github.com/mgk/couchdb-create-replication/raw/v1.0.0/couchdb-create-replication
chmod +x couchdb-create-replication
```

# Usage

```
couchdb-create-replication [-c] SOURCE TARGET
```

where:

  `-c` makes replication continous, if not specified the replication is only
     done once

  `SOURCE` - source database name (like "foo") or full database URL (like "http://server2:5984/bar")

  `TARGET` - target database name (like "foo") or full database URL (like "http://server2:5984/bar")

Both `SOURCE` and `TARGET` must already exist.

By default the replication request is sent to the local server (localhost:5984). Set the `SERVER` environment variable to use a different server.

A replication is one way: from source to target. To achieve master<->master replication create two replications:

```
couchdb-create-replication -c mydb http://server:5984/mydb
couchdb-create-replication -c http://server:5984/mydb mydb
```

# FAQs

**Q**: Why isn't there an option to automatically create the target DB?

**A**: Because I think it is easier to do that separately:

```
curl -X PUT localhost:5984/bar
```

**Q**: Why is `SERVER` an environment variable and not an optional argument?

**A**: Because I'm almost always doing this against the local server and I am not very good at shell script programming.

**Q**: How do I list the databases on a server?

**A**: `curl localhost:5984/_all_dbs`
